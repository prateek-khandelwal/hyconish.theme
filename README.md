This is a basic GNUStep theme, constructed, upto this point solely usoing image files (no code, except the plist files generated by thematic app)

I am attaching a few screenshots of a few basic apps.

The theme is pretty crude as of now, and draws its components, especially icons from various sources 

Currently, there are a lot of flaws, like broken tabs, overly thick borders of menu items etc

As far as I understand, these issues can be sorted out by coding the theme. But since I am quite new to Objective C, I thought fit to release the theme in its current state, as further improvements would require quite an investment of time, and this time can be used to get feedback.

Icons (particularly device and settings related icons) are extracted from Ivy Icon theme - http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/Ivy-371216510, 

while the folders icons belongs to the hycons Icon pack by http://gomezhyuuga.deviantart.com/art/Hycons-snap-14-07-11-169638293
